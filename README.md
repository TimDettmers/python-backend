# python-backend

Contains Keras based deep learning algorithms to create codes for image representation. The convolutional autoencoder works better than the normal autoencoder; the convolutional net is helpful to generate improving codes (linear before softmax) over time. 

Firebase is used for code communication and cudanet for distance computation.
